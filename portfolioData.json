        "description": "After delivering the previous project of STT pipeline, I worked on a realtime audio transcription system using Flask and various large language models (LLMs). The transcription process begins by capturing audio input, which is then processed to detect silence and manage recording efficiently. The system integrates multiple transcription services, applying robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls to ensure reliability. Additionally, it supports offline transcription using the Vosk framework. This project showcases my ability to integrate diverse technologies, implement complex workflows, and maintain a clean architecture while ensuring secure operations through logging and environment management."

The project includes over nine core files, with pipeline.py as the main entry point. It features main.py for routing, start.py and stop.py for recording control, and config.py for managing model configurations and API keys. The transcription is handled in process.py, while a .env file stores critical parameters securely. I implemented centralized logging in logger.py to ensure comprehensive session tracking. This project showcases my expertise in building complex systems from scratch, utilizing technologies like Flask and external libraries for audio processing, along with a clear architectural design illustrated in a high-level flowchart.",

The code was designed to identify source and destination locations, dates, and times from diverse texts, using regex patterns to capture various date and time formats, including relative references like 'tomorrow.' Additionally, I expanded the sentence analyzer to extract event names, guest counts, durations, and more, making the tool robust and versatile for applications in travel, event planning, and beyond. With over 1,500 lines of code, I'm proud of how this tool streamlines the process of gathering and organizing critical information, enhancing efficiency for users in both domains."

These projects were designed to help students gain practical experience with various layers of network protocols, utilizing tools such as NS2, Cisco Packet Tracer, and client-server programming in Python. For the final major project, students were tasked with transforming their third mini-project into a globally hosted chat server using ngrok or other third-party platforms. In addition to designing projects, my responsibilities included explaining project concepts, assisting students with lab work, and providing guidance on course material. I also supported grading for over 40 students, evaluating lab assignments, projects, and exams, ensuring timely and constructive feedback to help students improve their understanding of networking concepts. This experience allowed me to strengthen my communication and technical skills while contributing to a collaborative learning environment.",
